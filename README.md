# Playlist-Splitter
Split the long playlists as shown.


There are a lot of playlists on youtube like [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-otYSc8mF3I&t=1287s&ab_channel=vhs_death)

you can download this kind of playlist with mp3 downloaders like y2mate.

this tool helps you split the mp3 file according to timestamps file

in this instance I found the timestamps in the description of this video.

put this in text file and ran the program.

it gives several mp3 files 


you can transfer them to your phone or enjoy it on your pc
